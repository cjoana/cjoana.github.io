Welcome to **Cristian Joana**'s homepage. 

\\
I am a theoretical and computational physicist specializing in early Universe cosmology. My research interests include inflation, primordial black holes, and gravitational waves from cosmological sources. I combine numerical relativity and analytical approaches to explore fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of the Universe.

\\
I am currently transitioning to a postdoctoral position at **ICTP-AP in Beijing**. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the *Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITP-CAS)*. I have also been a visiting researcher at *Institute of Science Tokyo* in Ookayama/Tokyo and at the *Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)* in Brussels.

\\
I did my PhD at the **Universite Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain)** and my thesis focused on **numerical relativity approaches to the early Universe**, where I investigated initial conditions for inflation and scenarios involving gravitational collapse, particularly for the formation of primordial black holes. You can check out my [blog](https://cjoana.github.io/blogs/) pages where I write summaries of some of my publications. From time to time I make some video animation of my simulations, which can be found  youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/n0ian).

## Research Interests

### Early Universe Phenomenology

I study the dynamics of the very early Universe, including models of cosmic inflation and reheating/preheating. My work aims to connect theoretical models with observable imprints, such as scalar and tensor perturbations, through both analytical tools and numerical simulations.

### Formation of Compact Objects

I am particularly interested in the nonlinear dynamics that lead to the formation of exotic compact objects in the early Universe. This includes:
- **Primordial black holes (PBHs)**
- **Oscillons and Q-balls**
- **Other nonperturbative phenomena arising in scalar field theories**

These objects offer possible explanations for dark matter and probes into physics beyond the Standard Model.

### Gravitational Waves from Cosmological Sources

I study gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds arising from early Universe phenomena, including:
- Second-order GWs induced by scalar perturbations
- GWs from first-order phase transitions
- Signals from oscillons and other nonperturbative structures

I am particularly interested in the potential detectability of these signals by current and future observatories such as LISA, PTA, and advanced ground-based detectors.

## Interdisciplinary Research

In addition to cosmology, I have worked on dynamical quantum systems, particularly exciton-polaritons in condensed matter settings. My contributions include theoretical modeling of coupled light-matter systems with nonlinear interactions. See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00629) for more detailed information. 

I have also explored **systems neuroscience**, focusing on how the brain processes visual information. My collaborators and I use advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to match visual stimuli with neural responses in macaques under free-viewing conditions. Our publications can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09405-4) and [here](https://www.eneuro.org/content/10/10/ENEURO.0086-23.2023).  This research aims to uncover how the brain constructs a coherent visual experience from dynamic environments. I am not currenlty engenge in this line of research, but I always find it extremely intersting.
